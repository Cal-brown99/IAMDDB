User Experience (UX)

Strategy:

I understand that my target audience is fans of the artist who're general consumers. With this in mind
I need to make the website very easy on the eyes with pretty colours and features, as well as being
effortless to navigate through the different pages. 

I have researched IAMDDB to get a feel for her personality and characteristics to try and implement
that nto this webpage, so that the fans can get a true representation of the artist. At the same time
I have produced a large ratio of images to content to avoid overloading the customer/fan with too much
infomation and ultimatley being disinterested. If they want further infomation about the artist then 
i've provided links to all of her social media at the footer of each page.

Scope:

This is a fan webisite, so others can add content that they believe to be relevant and add
on extra music released by the artist.

Structure:

I have designed my website to be largley something nice to look at rarther than a lot of information.
Even though part of my UX is for the visitor to learn more about the artist, at the same time an 
everyday fan will mostly want to see nice images of the artist to get a feel for her style with little
content alongside it to give some information wiht it.

I have made sure that the visitor is exposed to a lot of bright colours and features to keep them 
glued to the screen. There's a drop down navigation bar with links to different pages; Home, Music, Shop
As well as included links on the music page to direct the fan to their favourite music sites with the
song/albumn that they've selected.
