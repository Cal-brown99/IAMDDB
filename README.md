to know the artist a little more as a person as well as discovering more of her music. On top
of that there's a page for all of her merchandise to promote the artist further and to bring 
the fans closer to her.

User Experience (UX)

Strategy:

I understand that my target audience is fans of the artist who're general consumers. With this in mind
I need to make the website very easy on the eyes with pretty colours and features, as well as being
effortless to navigate through the different pages. 

I have researched IAMDDB to get a feel for her personality and characteristics to try and implement
that nto this webpage, so that the fans can get a true representation of the artist. At the same time
I have produced a large ratio of images to content to avoid overloading the customer/fan with too much
infomation and ultimatley being disinterested. If they want further infomation about the artist then 
i've provided links to all of her social media at the footer of each page.

Scope:

This is a fan webisite, so others can add content that they believe to be relevant and add
on extra music released by the artist.

Structure:

I have designed my website to be largley something nice to look at rarther than a lot of information.
Even though part of my UX is for the visitor to learn more about the artist, at the same time an 
everyday fan will mostly want to see nice images of the artist to get a feel for her style with little
content alongside it to give some information wiht it.

I have made sure that the visitor is exposed to a lot of bright colours and features to keep them 
glued to the screen. There's a drop down navigation bar with links to different pages; Home, Music, Shop
As well as included links on the music page to direct the fan to their favourite music sites with the
song/albumn that they've selected.


Skeleton:

Page 1 (Home page) - This is where most of the content lies, explaining IAMDDB's career and getting to
 know her a little more as a person and connecting with her. Several images alongide the content to keep
 it interesting, also there's social media links at the bottom of the page.

Page 2 (Music) - This contains many links to all of the artists songs and albumns.

Page 3 (Shop) - Contains a sign up button at the top to promote merchndise for customers, as well as
 giving them 10% off their first purchase. Followed down the page is different images and links to varied
 mechandise.

 Surface:

 I wanted to keep the site theme quite open with a range of different tones and colours to try and relate
 to the artists diversity in her music that's why I stuck with a few different proffessional colours such as 
 the slate grey (#3B4242) and walnut brown (#B57A42), along with the off-white colour (#F7F9F9).

 Thefont I used throughout the project is "Lobster" and the reasing for hoosing this is because it's a fan
 website and I feel like that style font provides a fun read and represents the quirky character of the artist
 herself. Then as a default I had "Sans serif" to be used as the formal bit of writing for things such as forms
 or part of the footer.

 Balsamiq Wireframes: 

 ### Wireframes
> - [Wireframes](docs/IAMDDB-Wireframe.pdf): Rough designs of how I egitnvisioned my website to be and the layout of it.

Features:

I have laid out the website into several different pages with a Bootstrap Navabr at the top to navigate around the
different sites, as well as having put in hyperlinks to click on to take you to the appropriate place.

- My website is resposive to all screen sizes through Bootstrap and my media queries.
- The images of clothing once hovered over, flip to another image (back of the product) for a nice user experience.
- There is a form to sign up for an account, which is proffessionally laid out. Making it a requirement to input a 
  appropriate email address as well as showing astericks instead of showing you the password being inputed.
- In my footer I have created animations when hovered over the socail links to make them more responsive, as they
  change colour in accordance to the color scheme.
- I have provided fans with direct links to the artists albums and singles on music platforms such as apple and spotify.

Technologies & sites used:

- HTML
- CSS 
- Bootstrap
- Font awesome
- Google font
- free colour picker
- Balsamiq Wireframes
- Google chrome developer tools
- Gitpod

 Testing/Bugs:

 Throughout my project I have encountered many diffrent bugs with my website, mainly from the use of
 bootstrap and having the elements I want to position/style being overwritten by the boiler-plate coding.
 To overcome these bugs, I used the google dev tool to inspect what parameters each element and section had 
 and what I could do to manipulate it. It's great to use this as you can edit the website in real time then
 when you have what you want being displayed, then you can input the code into github.
